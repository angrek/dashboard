-make 'get servers' scripts 
-server exclusions and lists
-#FIXME server crashes if server name is unknown
-make the error checking a seperate module we can call

-get the honeydew module from the TBO vm
-write xcelys version script 

-error checking if values don't exist? (say a server is wrongly
    classified as AIX so oslevel -s doesn't work?

-output times so we have a rough idea how long each of these scripts are taking

-centrify update hanging on inactive server d1sysdir

-let's make a check all servers scripts to run before hand so we're not pinging the servers for every single script
