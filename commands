in /usr/src there's a tgz of python 2.7
To install it you must use --prefix=<whatever dir> when compiling and make altinstall rather than make install - VERY IMPORTANT or it will hose the system version of python

from my home directory

virtualenv -p /usr/local/bin/python2.7 EVN
source ENV/bin/activate
cd ENV
pip install https://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.7b1.tarball/

message that it's now installed into ENV/bin, and in fact it looks that way
and python runs as 2.7 so it looks like we're good and can run django from in here

I'm going to use port 8000 so as not to interfere with anything else here.
